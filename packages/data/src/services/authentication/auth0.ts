  notes: 'Auth0 verified from comprehensive official CSP documentation. New Universal Login automatically sets frame-ancestors: \'none\' and X-Frame-Options: deny (cannot be disabled). SPA SDK uses Web Workers - configure separate worker file to avoid blob CSP issues. Requires connect-src for tenant domain. Form-action should be \'none\' for SPAs. CSP-Report-Only recommended for testing.',
